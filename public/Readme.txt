Greetings! This is the first readme I've ever done, so take it easy, please. :P


<-- Testing -->
Now, testing the product itself is very simple. Simply unzip the contents of GithubIssuesTracker to somewhere on your computer,
then open up 'index.html' in a modern web browser. Due to a time constraint, I have only tested the website in the latest verions of Chrome (v48) and Firefox (v32).




<--About the Project -->

This project uses the Github API to track issues for any (public) project that you choose. Features include paging through the most current issues 30 issues at a time, instant checking whether a Github user was valid,
quick repository stats in the left sidebar, and a minimalistic/material UI that I actually ended up kind of liking.

I used jQuery, Bootstrap (default theme), CSS for "material UI" cards, and obviously, the Github API. All coding was done in Sublime Text 3.


<--Code Diligence-->
Yup, I probably could have moved more of the inline CSS to the external stylesheet. And objectified more of the JS subfunctions. I assure you I know how to do these things,
but I was in quite a rush to get this project finished (check the Github commit history...) since I wouldn't have access to the Internet for much of the weekend.
