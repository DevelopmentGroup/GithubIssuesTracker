This is the first readme I've ever done, so take it easy, please. :P\r\n\r\nNow, testing the product itself is very simple. Simply unzip the contents of GithubIssuesTracker to somewhere on your computer,\r\nthen open up 'index.html' in a modern web browser. Due to a time constraint, I have only tested the website in the latest verions of Chrome (v48) and Firefox (v32).\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to clone my work with git, the link is here: https://github.com/DevelopmentGroup/GithubIssuesTracker\r\n\r\nFor any questions or issues, please email me at jmc6yz@virginia.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n~Josh\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
