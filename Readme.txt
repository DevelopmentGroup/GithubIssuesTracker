Greetings! This is the first readme I've ever done, so take it easy, please. :P

Now, testing the product itself is very simple. Simply unzip the contents of GithubIssuesTracker to somewhere on your computer,
then open up 'index.html' in a modern web browser. Due to a time constraint, I have only tested the website in the latest verions of Chrome (v48) and Firefox (v32).

If you prefer to clone my work with git, the link is here: https://github.com/DevelopmentGroup/GithubIssuesTracker

For any questions or issues, please email me at jmc6yz@virginia.edu
